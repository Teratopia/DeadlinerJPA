# DeadlinerJPA

Deadliner is a site that keeps track of your events, showing you when they are set to happen, how much time you have left, and how much time has elapsed. The site implements full CRUD with options to sort deadlines by due date or priority, and Spring validation is used to encrypt passwords. The site was built with javascript, jQuery, java, and mysql.
